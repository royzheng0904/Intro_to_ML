        "This first lab assignment may be considered something of a warm-up exercise. It is an opportunity to get to grips with working in the Colab environment and get acquainted with some basic data generation and plotting. None of the tasks involve any actual **machine learning**, but they do introduce some models and mechanisms that will be extremely important in the weeks ahead.\n",
        "\n",
        "For each task, you are asked to write the code for some functions. The function interface is defined -- please do not change this -- and you are told what it should do. At the end of each task is a code cell that calls the functions and produces some results, usually in the form of plots. Some examples of what the completed plots might look like are shown below. Your outputs do not need to look exactly like these, but they will probably have the same general form. (In future lab assignments the plotting functions will often be provided for you, but in this introductory exercise you are asked to do the plotting yourself and can style it however you like.)\n",

        "\n",
        "Conversely, if you do not have any such experience, the exercises may be a bit daunting. Don't worry if some of the concepts seem strange and unfamiliar at this point. We'll go into linear models at length in week 2, and return to them frequently all the way through the module. For now, just try to understand the basic ideas. If you have problems, feel free to ask the tutors for help.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before we get to the actual tasks there are some subsections below introducing Colab and the notebook format and demonstrating some basic plotting. Feel free to skip over the **Using Colab** and **Basic Plotting** sections if you're already comfortable with those things, but please make sure to run all the code cells in the **Setting Up** section -- these import things that will be needed for the rest of the assignment.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are some potentially helpful utility functions in the `utils` module that gets downloaded and imported in **Setting Up**. You don't have to make use of these, but it is probably worth having a look at them, as they can help avoid some tedious mucking about with things like array axis ordering.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note:** A couple of this week's exercises can be reduced to one-liners with judicious use of `utils`, but the resulting code is rather cryptic. You'll probably find it helpful to code things in more explicit steps to begin with. (This week's example solutions will do things both ways.)\n"

This is really **never what you want** and can give rise to all kinds of problems with inconsistent state. Always be sure to run cells in order.

If you don't do anything for awhile, the notebook may disconnect from the virtual machine. If you use too much computation then your session may be halted — and what qualifies as \"too much\" is kept intentionally vague. VMs are purged daily: if you stop and come back to it tomorrow the VM will have been deleted and you will need to go back to the beginning and go through the setup steps again. If you generate something that you want to keep, you should download it to your local machine.\n"
